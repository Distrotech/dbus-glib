==

 - Only use -Wfloat-equal if compiler supports it (Closes #7658. Thanks to Jens Granseuer <jensgr@gmx.net> for the patch).
 - Return NULL from g_return_val_if_fail in dbus_g_proxy_begin_call (Closes #4159.)
 - Add dbus-gidl.h to IGNORE_HFILES for doxygen docs
 - Update tools/Makefile.am for new dbus-binding-tool behaviour
 - Remove bashism in make-dbus-glib-error-enum.sh (Closes #6700).
 - Fix introspection when object has exported properties. (dbus-gobject:write_interface was completely broken)
 - Fix thanks to mccann@jhu.edu. (Closes #8607).
 - Require --prefix in dbus-binding-tool (Closes #4185).
 - Dont shadow index. Rename useage of index to index_. Thanks stdlib... (Closes #8353).
 - Fix small leak when marshal_table is destroyed (Closes #6870 with patch from Richard Hult <richard@imendio.com>).
 - Fixes crash if disposing one DBusGProxy causes another for the same service to be unrefed in a destoyed callback.
 - Use modern AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
 - Clean generated run-with-tmp-session-bus.conf on make clean
 - Actually run unit tests and checks when doing make distcheck
 - Use TEST_CORE_SERVICE_BINARY path for core test service file
 - Use dbus-daemon --introspect to generate DBus service introspect xml
 - Add tests for new interfaces functionaility
 - Bump GLib dependancy to 2.6 (Closes #4390).
 - Add gobject-2.0 to dbus-glib-1.pc.in
 - Puts all exposed servies in the org.freedesktop.DBus.GLib namespace
 - Update COPYING and HACKING to be correct for dbus-glib
 - Move tests/glib to test/core
 - Rename configure.in to configure.ac for modernity
 - Fix memleak in lookup_or_register_specialized (Applies fix from Daniel d'Andrada Ten√≥rio de Carvalho, closing bug #7352).
 - Add an m4 directory and add gtk-doc.m4, which is installed in the tree by gtkdocize.
 - tools/Makefile.am: Add tools/session.conf to EXTRA_DIST so make check works from tarballs
 - Fix compilation with -Werror
 - Make test scripts run during out-of-tree compilation
 - Fix out-of-tree compilation
 - Replace doxygen with gtk-doc in INSTALL
 - Commit patch to switch to gtk-doc with gtype-specialized doc and
 - Updates from Marc-Andre Lureau <marcandre.lureau@gmail.com>, with minor cleanup. (Closes #7726.)

D-Bus GLib Bindings 0.71 (24 July 2006)
==
- Correctly installs a few missing headers
- Build was cleaned up a bit

D-Bus GLib Bindings 0.70 (17 July 2006)
==
- First release after bindings split
- dbus-binding-tool heeds org.freedesktop.DBus.GLib.ClientCSymbol C symbol
  name annotations when generating glib client bindings
- DBusGProxy can now be inherited from
- Support added for generating bindings to arrays that are represented as 
  GPtrArrays rather than GArrays (ie size-variable things, such as strings, 
  objects, structs, etc).
- Modification of the existing specialised types to have N type parameters 
  (rather than the current 1 or 2 for arrays and dictionaries respectively).
  You can then use this to get a glib type to represent any arbitrary
  D-Bus struct type using dbus_g_type_get_struct. The only implementation of 
  these types is with GValueArrays as before, but it's now possible to store 
  these in arrays, emit them in signals, etc.
- New methodbus_g_connection_open provides a way to open connections to an 
  arbitrary address
- Various bugs and memory leaks fixed
