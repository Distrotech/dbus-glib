The mainline git tree for this code is at
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib.

if you are making major changes which you wish to be incorporated upstream,
please do as small commits to your local git tree, so there is a good
history of your changes.

When you consider changes ready for merging to mainline, either use 
"git-format-patch" or otherwise generate diffs.  Post those diffs
to a new bug at http://bugs.freedesktop.org, project DBus, component GLib.

= Testing =
For nontrivial changes *please* try to extend the test suite to cover it.  The
test infrastructure is in test/core/, and currently there are a lot of tests
in the single file test/core/test-dbus-glib.c.  Extending this file is
suggested (in the future we would like to break this file up).

Run "make check" to run the test suite.

= Making a release =

DBus-Glib now uses an even-stable odd-development release numbering
system.  The current number in configure.ac should be odd.

To make a release:

* make
* make distcheck
* edit configure.ac, change version to even (e.g. 0.75 -> 0.76)
* ./autogen.sh
* make
* make distcheck
* git commit -m "Release"
* scp resulting tarball to ssh://gabe.freedesktop.org/srv/dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib
* edit configure.ac, change version to odd (e.g. 0.76 -> 0.77)
* git commit -m "Bump version for development"
* Update the wiki: http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/DBusBindings
* Announce the release on the mailing list
