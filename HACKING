The mainline git tree for this code is at
git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/dbus/dbus-glib.

if you are making major changes which you wish to be incorporated upstream,
please do as small commits to your local git tree, so there is a good
history of your changes.

When you consider changes ready for merging to mainline, either use 
"git-format-patch" or otherwise generate diffs.  Post those diffs
to a new bug at http://bugs.freedesktop.org, project DBus, component GLib.

= Testing =
For nontrivial changes *please* try to extend the test suite to cover it.  The
test infrastructure is in test/core/, and currently there are a lot of tests
in the single file test/core/test-dbus-glib.c.  Extending this file is
suggested (in the future we would like to break this file up).

Run "make check" to run the test suite.
